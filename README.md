# Pandas Challenge

This repository is for a homework challenge for my UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Boot Camp, utilizing Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook.

The task was to read in a CSV file with data for a free (fictional) mobile game called "Heroes of Pymoli" and analyse information about the players and in-game purchases. The original CSV file is under HeroesOfPymoli/Resources and the Jupyter Notebook file reading and processing the data is found in the HeroesOfPymoli directory.
